    <h1>Energy transition in Europe: Which country is the real role model?</h1>

    <p class="lead"> Exchange fossil energy with green energy — that's the aim of Europe's energy transition. Germany is seen as a blueprint, maybe not legitimately though.</i></p>

    <p><br>Cutting energy demand, shut down all nuclear reactors and most important: satisfy the energy demand increasingly with renewable energy -- that's the core of the energy transition underway in Europe.</br>

    <br>And Germany is said to be the role model for it.</br>

    <br>In absolute numbers, it consumes and produces the largest amount of renewable energy.</br>

    <br>Looking at relative figures however shifts the image:</br></p>

    <img src="energy_renewablevsother_1104_1056.png" alt="Renewable vs non renewable energy consumption by country" style="width:1104px;height:1056px;">

    <p>Probably, it is more difficult to have a great share of renewable energy, if the overall energy consumption is high and a country is defined by a big, energy-consuming industry.</br>

    <br>To check whether there might be exceptions from this assumption, the renewable shares were put into more context: the overall energy consumption and GDP per capita.</p>

    <img src="energy_scatter_1086_853.png" alt="Renewable energy consumption in relation to GDP" style="width:1086px;height:853px;">

    <p>If you break down overall energy consumption by sector, industry and households each account for quarter of overall consumption.</br>

    <br>Thus, if a country like Germany wants to cut its energy demand, it’s not only households that need to save energy, but also the industrial sector. One measure to trigger a change is to alter the price you have to pay per kilowatthour (kWh). However energy is usually cheaper for industries than for households.<br>

    <br>And the alleged role model Germany even increased prices slightly, whereas Norwegian consumers pay roughly half as much -- with a trend of further falling prices.</p>

    <br>These graphics are a starting point for an article that was published in <a href="https://www.derkontext.com/thema/energiewende/article/60">Der Kontext</a> outlining why Germany might still be a role model (despite the facts outlined above) and what European countries can learn from renewable-energy-heroes like Norway, Sweden and Iceland.
