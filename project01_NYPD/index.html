    <h1>Police discrimination: NYPD stop-and-frisk numbers drop, racial bias remains</h1>

    <p class="lead">Arbitrary and racially biased: The NYPD's stop-and-frisk practice received a lot of criticism in the past. Data show a decline in practice, however the racial bias prevails.</i></p>

    <p>After <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices">heavy criticism</a> in 2011 and a 2013 ruling <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/nyregion/stop-and-frisk-practice-violated-rights-judge-rules.html?_r=0">declaring NYPD's stop-and-frisk as unconstitutional</a>, data proves a sharp decline of on the practice:</p>

    <img src="NYPD_timeseries_960_557.png" alt="Timeseries of NYPD stopping people" style="width:960px;height:557px;">

    <p>However, the racial bias - one of the critics' main argument - remains unchanged: Still black and hispanic people are stopped disproportionally more often than white people.</p>

    <img src="NYPD_racial_breakdown_PNG_960_586.png" alt="Racial breakdown of people stopped by the NYPD", style="width:960px;height:586px;">

    <p>On top of that, after being stopped, black and hispanic people are also frisked more often than white people.</p>

    <img src="NYPD_frisked_960_640.png" alt="Share of people who are frisked out of those who are stopped" style="width:960px;height:640px;">

    <p>Each data-entry is assigned a "crime code description", suggesting what a person was stopped for. The five most frequent ones in 2015 are 'criminal possession of a weapon' (30% of stops), 'robbery' (14% of stops), 'grand larceny auto' (10% of stops), 'bulgary' (9% of stops), and 'assault' (6% of stops). The data records do not detail if stops are based suspicion of these crimes or based on evidence.</p>

    <p>However, 2015 data suggest that out of 100 people stopped, only 17 would be arrested, whereas only 2 would be summonsed -- proving the point of the practice still being arbitrary. One possible reason might be <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/stop-and-frisk-continues-cops-don-reforms-article-1.2533429">that not yet all officers are aware of the reform, analysts argue</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are wondering what offenses people got arrested or summonsed for -- you unfortunately have to keep wondering: data on reasons for arrests and summons are  gathered non-systematically.</p>
